# Project: A small endeavor towards data analysis (100 points)

While big data analytics may need packages such as numpy and/or pandas for processing. Here we explore a few steps of data analysis using Python’s basic features such as file I/O and lists. You may need to restrict the dataset size not exceeding 1MB.

* Step 1: Find a data set by yourself. Suggest to use a dataset of a few KB that you find from data sites such as Kaggle.com. You decide which and what kind of data file you’d use. 

* Step 2: Write Python code to read in data from the file, and analyze the data. The analysis of data could include but not limited to the distribution/spread of the datasets. 

* Step 3: Visualize your analysis results (not every result needs to be visualized, some could be in table format, or some just a simple value, e.g. sum, average, median, etc.)

* Step 4: Present some analysis of your results, i.e. what does a result mean? For example, if you calculated a class average for a test, the result shows 60 over 100. You could infer that the test is too hard or most students didn’t do well. (Optional) if your results demonstrate an issue/problem (e.g. test too hard) provide some suggests for improvement or solving the problem.

Submission: 
1. A presentation slides containing the following:
	(1) Project goal/statement: a short description about your project (suggest: 1 slide)
(2) Dataset(s): where you get the data, file format and size, what the raw data look like i.e. show a few lines of data. (suggest 1 or 2 slides)
(3) Your analysis of data (4 – 8 results with at least 2 visualized) and interpretation of each result. (suggestion: for each result from the analysis, show the Python code, the result either in numerical/text form or visualized chart, followed by a brief interpretation.)
(4) Optional: summary of issues/problems found from your analysis and suggestion, if any for solving the problem or for improvement. 
 2. A link to your dataset and source code or attach the data file and source code to your submission. Do not zip up files.

Grading Criteria:
Overall presentation of your project (e.g. project goal, slide design/presentation, …) 10 points
Dataset description:			10 points
Analysis & interpretations		80 points (4 x 20 points)
Bonus (up to 20 points)	Extra analysis results (i.e. beyond required minimum 4, max 10 points), suggestion for improvement/solution (max 10 points)
